## Behavior

- **Balance Withdrawal**: Any remaining balance on the card is automatically withdrawn to your wallet
- **Provider Closure**: The card is terminated at the provider level (irreversible)
- **Database Update**: Card status is set to "closed" in the database
- **No Balance**: If card has zero balance, no withdrawal transaction is created

<Warning>
  **Irreversible Action**: Closing a card is permanent. The card cannot be reactivated after closure.
</Warning>

## Validation Rules

- Card must have a valid `provider_id` (not 'temp')
- Card must not already be closed
- 15-minute cooldown between withdrawal/closure operations
